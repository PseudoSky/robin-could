Designs I created for a CNC router 
- Designs are sized and shaped to with emphasis on easy utilization of recycled materials
- The final product has a price point (without using recycled materials) at 1/50th of the cost of a consumer grade alt.
- The machine in these designs has a scalable frame, allowing for custom dimensions in the X & Y axes - (working area)
